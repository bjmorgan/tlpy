In no particular order:

- Add self-consistent Fermi energy calculation
- Add defect concentration calculations (with Boltzmann + correct stat mech for crystal sites)
- Look into defect complex corrections
- Finish adding doc strings
- Write documentation / minimal working examples
- Implement alternate image-charge corrections
- Complete test coverage of code
